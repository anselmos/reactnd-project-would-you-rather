# Udacity React Nanodegree project "Would you rather."

The project uses react and redux for making a simple Would-you-rather questionnaire which contains:
- adding new questions
- voting
- leaderboard ( for how many questions created and answered.)
- an hard-coded login setup (maybe updated to registration/login in future)

This runs yarn installer for any node requirements of project.
